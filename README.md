# sulfur-potassium-mod
Mod for Minecraft Forge
This mod adds two new blocks to Minecraft: Sulfur Ore and Potassium Ore.
It is meant to be a vanilla friendly way to craft more gunpowder.

Sulfur drops raw sulfur. It can be found in both overworld and nether. It has a higher spawn rate in the nether.
Potassium drops blocks, just like iron, and can be smelted into raw potassium. It can only be found in the overworld
With raw sulfur and potassium can you can then make gunpowder!
